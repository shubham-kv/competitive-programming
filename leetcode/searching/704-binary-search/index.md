### Problem Statement

> Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an
> integer `target`, write a function to search target in `nums`. If `target` exists,
> then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.  
> You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Notes

- Dry run through every line of code one by one helped me for this one.

### Solutions

- [C](./c/binary_seach.c), [Typescript](./ts/binary-search.ts)
